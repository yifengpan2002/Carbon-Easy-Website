# Carbon-Easy-Website
This is the high fidelity prototype I had built for my Assignment 3 of 345 compsci paper. I dont need to make the website responsive (just the register needs to pop up a modial-window). I need to theme my website through the color they given to me. 

In this website, I have used some common fate law, reflective law, proximity principle and area law. I have also used colour contrast to compare the background colour and the text colour. Also some accessibilities factors had been considered when building the website (ie for those user that cannot use mouse, but they can register and close the modial-window though keyboard, using tab and enter)
